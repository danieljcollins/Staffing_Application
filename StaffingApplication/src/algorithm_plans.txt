Algorithm Purpose: Output schedule data to PDF
Tools to perform this: PDFBox API

Approach 1: PDFBox API allows the programmer to "draw" lines using programmed steps.
	One approach would be to hard-code each line of a "grid" that would include cell data
	similar to a spreadsheet (or a typical work schedule) with employee names, dates listed
	and the shift times, shift names etc. as needed.
	
	The overall concept would be to input the "drawing" of words while making the hard-coded lines
	which reflect the dynamic schedule data. From there, alternative hard-coded line setups could be programmed
	to make specific types of output. Such as outputting one employee's schedule only, or ALL employees schedules in
	one PDF file.
